# About Me 👋
Hi. I'm Jake Wolfe from Melbourne Florida, and I'm into taking very large sets of data and breaking them down to tell their story. I really enjoy working with Python, SQL, HTML5/CSS and JavaScript, just to name a few. I've been working on some projects that you may find interesting; the links are below.  Feel free to have a look around!  My goal is to help drive business decisions that not only promote growth of the company and team, they guarantee it.

When I'm not diving into data, I am a husband to a beautiful wife, and father to two beautiful children.  They are the biggest inspirations in my life. I also enjoy the outdoors, traveling and spending time with family and friends.
